/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model where all
 * personal fitness data is isolated and accessible only to the authenticated
 * user who owns it. This provides strong privacy and data protection.
 *
 * Data Structure: All user-specific data, including profiles, workout plans, and
 * exercise logs, is nested under the path `/users/{userId}`. This hierarchical
 * structure allows for simple, path-based security rules that are highly
 * performant. A top-level `/exercises` collection serves as a global,
 * publicly-readable catalog of available exercises.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Isolation: A user can only read or write data within their own
 *   `/users/{userId}` data tree. Access to other users' data is strictly denied.
 * - Public Catalog: The `/exercises` collection is readable by anyone, including
 *   unauthenticated users, to allow the app to display available exercises.
 *   However, write access to this collection is disabled in the rules to prevent
 *   tampering. It should be managed via the Firebase console or a trusted backend.
 * - No User Listing: It is not possible to list all user documents in the
 *   `/users` collection, protecting user privacy.
 * - Relational Integrity: On creation, documents must contain an ID field (e.g.,
 *   `userProfileId`) that matches the corresponding ID in the path, ensuring
 *   data consistency. These IDs are immutable and cannot be changed on update.
